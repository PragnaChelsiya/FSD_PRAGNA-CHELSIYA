        <p>Using buttons with the Grid concept is generally a better choice for creating a calculator layout in web development. Buttons provide built-in click behavior and are easy to work with in JavaScript, while the CSS Grid layout helps organize them neatly in rows and columns. This makes the interface more structured, responsive, and easier to maintain. Without Grid, buttons can become difficult to align properly, especially for layouts that follow a fixed pattern like calculators. Therefore, combining buttons with the Grid concept gives both functional and visual advantages, making it a more efficient approach. </p>
